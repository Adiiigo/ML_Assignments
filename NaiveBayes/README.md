- This code is written in java and it is using weka API
- The dataset on which naive bayes algorithm is performed is attached and we are using arff file.
--------------
- Naive Bayes algorihm used bayes theorem.
- Here, I have tried to split the dataset into training dataset and test dataset.
- Perform evaluation metrics class-wise.
- Along with it I have applied cross validation method which divides the dataset into 10 parts and apply naive bayes model.
