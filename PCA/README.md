 - This code is written in R
 - The dataset on which the code is implementedi also provided.
 __________________
  - The main aim of principal component analysis is to convert the original predictors into principal components which makes it easier to analyze data.
  - It helps us to work on the data which has high variance.
  - In our dataset, the data is varied very much and thus, it becomes easier to see those changes.
  - All similar predictors contribute to one principal component.
  - First principal component gives the highest variance which implies it camptures maximum variance of the dataset.
  - Second principal component is orthogonal to first principal component and camptures the data which in other direction.
  - Number of principal components is always equal to the original predictors
